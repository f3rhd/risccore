# 5-Stage Pipelined RISC-V CPU + Custom Made FS Language
![CPU Logic Diagram](docs/assets/cpu_logic_diagram.png)

* A **5-stage pipelined RISC-V CPU** implemented in SystemVerilog
* A custom **assembler** for RISC-V machine code generation
* A **C-like high-level language (FS) compiler** that lowers into RISC-V assembly

Itâ€™s designed for educational purposes and to explore **compiler + CPU co-design**.

---

## Features

* **CPU**: Classic 5 pipeline stages (**IF, ID, EX, MEM, WB**) with forwarding and branch handling
* **Assembler**: Simple RISC-V assembler with optional IR output
* **Compiler (FS)**: A C-like language with functions, loops, pointers, arrays, and custom syntax
* **Examples**: Programs for both assembler and FS are provided in `docs/compiler/examples/` and `docs/assembler/examples/`

### Building

### Requirements

* `g++` (C++14 or newer)

### Build Compiler + Assembler

Detailed instructions for building the compiler and assembler are available in the documentation:

* **[Building the Compiler (FS)](docs/compiler/compiler.md)**
* **[Building the Assembler](docs/assembler/assembler.md)**
-----

## Usage

### Assembler

Output Machine Code:

```bash
./assembler program.s program.bin
```

Examples: `docs/assembler/examples/`

### Compiler (FS)

Compile an FS program (`program.fs`) into RISC-V assembly:

```bash
./fsrvc program.fs --emit-asm program.s
```

Examples: `docs/compiler/examples/`

## Documentation

Detailed documentation can be found in the `docs/` folder:

  * **CPU Overview**
      * Pipeline
      * Registers
      * Instructions
      * Hazards

## Notes & Limitations

This project is primarily **educational** and demonstrates the interaction between a CPU and its compiler. While fully functional, there are some limitations:

- **Minimal error handling:** Syntax or type errors may not always produce clear messages.  
- **Unoptimized machine code:** The compiler prioritizes correctness and debuggability over performance.  
- **Assembler limitations:** Only a subset of RISC-V is supported; some directives (e.g., `.globl`, `.text`) are omitted.  
- **Simplified memory model:** Assumes ideal conditions with 0-cycle memory access.  

> **Note:** The included examplesâ€”Min/Max of an array, Factorial calculation, and Insertion Sortâ€”work correctly. However, the compiler is still a work in progress, and hidden bugs may exist. **The CPU executes the generated machine code flawlessly; there are no CPU bugs.** Use this project for learning and experimentation! ðŸ’–
